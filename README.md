Free time is the enemy of progress.

This is a NodeJS Project focused on: 
  
  music via soundcloud
  
  get, post, requests with angularJS
  
  teamwork with that kid Peter Soboyejo (dzt, skizzy, pxt3r, crxdit, pxtvr, etc. etc.)
  
  It's also a project that shows that github pages is slowly dying because... I could not even launch this site without 404ing.

Here's the Heroku site. 

( http://soundmeow.herokuapp.com )

The site allows you input a song name, an artist's name, and will return the song if available, or an artist's tracks if available. Includes a feature where it uses a search engine to find images of the requested song or artist, and returns the image to the client side along with the song. 

This feature will crash the website. (There are daily limits for requests, which I crashed within 10-20 minutes of just playing around on the website)

Also taking a look at giphy's API, which is very developer friendly towards public access keys, but may lack the resources that google's custom search engine gives us.

We're currently working on looking at user tracks to find the genre they like and creating a playlist based on what they like. We're also looking to create playlists based on their searches. The iOS app/Android app will be in motion soon.

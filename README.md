Free time is the enemy of progress.

This is a NodeJS Project focused on: 
  
  music via soundcloud
  
  get, post, requests with angularJS
  
  teamwork with that kid Peter Soboyejo (dzt, skizzy, pxt3r, crxdit, pxtvr, etc. etc.)
  
  It's also a project that shows that github pages is slowly dying because... I could not even launch this site without 404ing.

# soundmeow
Free time is the enemy of progress.

This is a NodeJS Project focused on: 
  
  music via soundcloud,
  
  get, post, requests with angularJS,
  
  teamwork with that kid Peter Soboyejo (dzt, skizzy, pxt3r, crxdit, pxtvr, etc. etc.), and
  
  It's also a project that shows that github pages is slowly dying because... I could not even launch this site
  
( http://ichauster.github.io/soundmeow );
